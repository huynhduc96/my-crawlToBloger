  They said that she only had 5-10% chance of survival, but this brave wee one
  with bent front legs surprised everyone with her inspiring, fighting spirit.We
  are talking about none other than Lilo the miracle cat!In September, a litter
  of 5 kittens came to Tenth Life after being abandoned by their feral mama cat.
  They were born with front legs that were formed improperly. Though extremely
  young, Lilo has permanently bent front legs, this fur baby doesn’t act like
  she’s any different from any other kitten.Little did the rescue group know
  that the kittens’ lives were challenged by panleukopenia, also known as feline
  distemper with a survival rate of only 5-10% for kittens under two months of
  age. Four of the kittens did not survive but Lilo wasn’t willing to go down
  without a struggle.Miraculously, Lilo was one of the 5-10% who pulled
  through!“(At the ER) she had a very high fever for 24 hours that they fought
  to get under control and luckily her system finally responded and joined the
  fight. Even when her foster mom was holding Lilo, waiting for the doctor, she
  purred heartily and rubbed her face all over in a display of affection,” Tenth
  Life told the great people at Love Meow.“Her foster mom felt like that was her
  letting me know (as a representative of the whole litter) that they felt loved
  and really loved me back as their Mommy.’ Bobbi continues, ‘we had a pep talk
  that I needed her to hold down the fort and be okay.’ Luckily, Lilo fought and
  did just that!”“As spunky and playful as she is, she’s still super cuddly and
  has purry trills that she makes when snuggled. She loves rubbing her nose
  against (and UP) her foster mom’s and lays her head on her shoulder with eyes
  closed when having her cheeks kissed, soaking it all in. She’s so little but
  sooo special!”“Not only did this darling survive, she is now thriving in her
  foster home, and we couldn’t be happier. In fact, she has even mastered the
  stairs! Every day, we are grateful for this little lady’s strength, and we
  send her all the positive, healing energy we can.”“Two weeks out of the ER and
  Lilo is doing wonderful. She has mastered climbing the stairs of our home,
  loves supervised playtime with the resident cats and is full of spunk while
  still loving to cuddle,” Bobbi who is Lilo’s foster mom, said.Lilo has kicked
  feline distemper’s butt and she doesn’t let her bent legs stop her from
  enjoying and living her life. This miracle kitty loves life to the fullest!
